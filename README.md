In our recent endeavor exploring stroke prediction, we delved into a treasure trove of data to uncover the major risk factors associated with this critical health issue. 🚑💼
🔍 Our dataset was rich with information on patients, both those affected by stroke and those who were not. With variables including age, gender, work type, smoking habits, blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and BMI, we embarked on a journey to unearth the key insights that could potentially save lives. 💻📈

Key Steps Taken:
1️⃣ Data Extraction: Sourced raw data from Krupa Health Care's vast repositories.
2️⃣ Data Transformation: Refined and processed the data for actionable insights.
3️⃣ Data Loading: Seamlessly uploaded transformed data onto our cutting-edge analytics platform.
4️⃣ DAX Implementations: Employed advanced Data Analysis Expressions for in-depth data manipulation.
5️⃣ Data Visualization: Presented captivating insights through visually stunning charts and graphs.

🔑 Insights Unveiled:
1️⃣ Individuals aged 55 and above, with a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, and a smoking habit, exhibited a staggering stroke rate of 36%, highlighting the profound impact of lifestyle factors on health outcomes.
2️⃣ Conversely, patients under the age of 30, without a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or smoking, demonstrated a remarkably low stroke rate of just 0.14%, underscoring the importance of early prevention strategies.
3️⃣ Major risk factors contributing to stroke incidence include smoking habits, advancing age, heart disease, diabetes, and BMI levels.
